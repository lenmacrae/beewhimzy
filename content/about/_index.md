+++
My name is Nicole MacRae and I am from the Canadian Maritimes. Social Worker by day and Mama and Wife all year round, I found my love for knitting and crocheting when I was forced on bedrest with my one and only little bee. 

All of the items in the shop have been handmade by me, and many of them have been my own pattern designs as well. Most importantly, every design in the Bee Whimzy shop has been proven (by my own very busy toddler and her friends) to wear well, feel comfortable and come out of the washing machine (gentle cycle) unscathed.

Any item in the shop can be customized to meet your little bee's needs, including size and colour. 

The Bee Whimzy shop is always open for trades or collaborations. Email anytime!

_Some important information on our designs:_

\* Rompers run a bit bigger than the average clothing store. This extra room allows for diaper variations and breathing room to accommodate your babe's busy lifestyle. If you are unsure if a Romper will fit, please email me your child's measurements and the design can be customized to meet your needs. Measurements would include:

- Collarbone to Bottom of Diaper

- Width of Chest

- Width around the belly

\* Bloomers run a bit bigger than the average shorts/diaper cover. This extra room allows for diaper variations and room to grow so your bloomers will last the whole season through.

\* Halter designs are open back or open shoulder. If you would prefer a tank top design, please message me and we can create a custom order that best meets your needs.

\* Though all designs are machine washable on the gentle cycle, Bee Whimzy would recommend hand washing in cold water whenever possible.
